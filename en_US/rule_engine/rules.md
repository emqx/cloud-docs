# Rule

The rule describes the three configurations of "where the data comes from", "how to filter and process the data", and "where the processing results go". That is to say, a usable rule contains three elements:

- Trigger event: The rule is triggered by an event, and the event injects the context information (data source) of the event into the rule when triggered. The event type is specified through the FROM clause of SQL;
- Processing rules (SQL): Use SELECT clause and WHERE clause and built-in processing functions to filter and process data from context information;
- Response action: If there is a processing result output, the rule will execute the corresponding action, such as persisting to the database, republishing the processed message, and forwarding the message to the message queue. A rule can configure multiple response actions.



## A simple example

The rule shown in the figure below is used to process the data when **message is published**, filter out the msg field, message topic and qos of all topic messages, and send them to the Web Server and /uplink topics. You can refer to [EMQX Rules](https://docs.emqx.io/broker/latest/en/rule/rule-engine.html) for more  guidelines.

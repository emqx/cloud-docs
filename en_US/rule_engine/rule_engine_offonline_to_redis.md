# Store Device Offline Messages to Redis Using the Rule Engine

In this article, we will simulate temperature and humidity data and report these data to EMQX Cloud via the MQTT protocol and then use the EMQX Cloud rules engine to dump the offline messages into Redis.

Before you start, you need to complete the following operations:
* Deployments have already been created on EMQX Cloud (EMQX Cluster).
* For professional deployment users: Please complete [Peering Connection Creation](../deployments/vpc_peering.md) first, all IPs mentioned below refer to the intranet IP of the resource.
* For basic deployment users: No peering connection is required, all IPs below refer to the public IP of the resource.

## Redis configuration

1. Install Redis

   ```bash
   docker run -itd --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
   ```

## EMQX Cloud rules engine configuration

Go to Deployment Details and click on EMQX Dashbaord to go to Dashbaord.

1. New Resource

   Click on Rules on the left menu bar → Resources, click on New Resource and drop down to select the Redis single-node mode resource type. Fill in the Redis information you have just created and click Test. If there is an error, instantly check that the database configuration is correct.

2. Rule Testing
   Click on Rules on the left menu bar → Rules, click on Create and enter the following rule to match the SQL statement. We will read out its message information, if the topic is `temp_hum/emqx`.

   ```sql
   SELECT
       *
   FROM
       "temp_hum/emqx",
       "$events/session_subscribed",
       "$events/message_acked"
   WHERE
       topic =~ 'temp_hum/emqx'
   ```

3. Add a response action

   Click on Add Action in the bottom left corner, drop down and select → Offline Message → Save Offline Message to Redis, select the resource created in the first step.

   ::: tip Tip
   Here you need to plan for the Redis Key expiration time, and it is recommended to save no more than 100 messages offline

4. Click on New Rule and return to the list of rules
   ![rule list](./_assets/view_rule_engine_offonline_redis.png)

5. View rules monitoring

## Test

1. Use [MQTT X](https://mqttx.app/) to simulate temperature and humidity data reporting

   You need to replace broker.emqx.io with the created deployment [connection address](../deployments/view_deployment.md), and add [client authentication information](../deployments/auth.md) to the EMQX Dashboard.

2. View data dump results

    ```bash
    $ docker exec -it redis bash
    $ redis-cli
    $ keys *
    ```
   ![redis](./_assets/offonline_redis_query_result.png)

3. Use [MQTT X](https://mqttx.app/) to consume offline data
   In MQTT X, subscribe to topic temp_hum/emqx to get offline data.

4. View the data consumed by redis

   ```bash
   $ docker exec -it redis bash
   $ redis-cli
   $ keys *
   ```

# Bridge device data to Kafka using the Rule Engine

In this article, we will simulate temperature and humidity data and report these data to EMQX Cloud via the MQTT protocol and then use the EMQX Cloud rules engine to dump the data into Kafka.

Before you start, you need to complete the following operations:
* Deployments have already been created on EMQX Cloud (EMQX Cluster).
* For professional deployment users: Please complete [Peering Connection Creation](../deployments/vpc_peering.md) first, all IPs mentioned below refer to the intranet IP of the resource.
* For basic deployment users: No peering connection is required, all IPs below refer to the public IP of the resource.

## Kafka configuration

1. Install Kafka

    ```bash
    # Install zookeeper
    docker run -d --restart=always \
        --name zookeeper \
        -p 2181:2181 \
        zookeeper

    # Install Kafka and open port 9092
    docker run -d  --restart=always --name mykafka \
        -p 9092:9092 \
        -e HOST_IP=localhost \
        -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_PORT=9092 \
        -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_HOST_NAME=<server IP> \
        -e KAFKA_BROKER_ID=1 \
        -e KAFKA_LOG_RETENTION_HOURS=12 \
        -e KAFKA_LOG_FLUSH_INTERVAL_MESSAGES=100000 \
        -e KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=<server IP>:2181 \
        -e ZK=<server IP> \
        wurstmeister/kafka
    ```

2. Create a topic

    ```bash
    # Create the "emqx" topic in the Kafka instance
   
    $ docker exec -it mykafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper <broker IP>:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic emqx --create
  
    ```
   
    If the topic is successfuly created, the message pf `Created topic emqx` will be returned.

## EMQX Cloud rule engine configuration

Go to the `Rule Engine` page

1. Create a new resource

   Click on the `+ New`  button in the `Resources` section and select `Kafka` as the resource type. Fill in the Kafka information you have just created and click Test. If you get an error, instantly check that the database configuration is correct.
   ![create resource](./_assets/kafka_create_resource.png)

2. Create a new rule

   Click on the `+ New`  button in the `Rules` section. Enter the following rule to match the SQL statement.  In the following rule we read the time `up_timestamp` when the message is reported, the client ID, the message body (Payload) from the `temp_hum/emqx` topic and the temperature and humidity from the message body respectively.

   ```sql
   SELECT 
   
   timestamp as up_timestamp, clientid as client_id, payload.temp as temp, payload.hum as hum
   
   FROM
   
   "temp_hum/emqx"
   ```
   ![rule sql](./_assets/sql_test.png)

3. Create a response action 
   
   Click on the `Add Action` toward the bottom of the page and select action type as `Data Forwarding` and `Bridge Data to Kafka`. Select the resource created in the first step and fill in the following data:

   Kafka topic: emqx
   Message content template:
   
   ```
   {"up_timestamp": ${up_timestamp}, "client_id": ${client_id}, "temp": ${temp}, "hum": ${hum}}
   ```
   ![kafka action](./_assets/kafka_action.png)

5. View rules monitoring
   
   Go back to the `Rule Engine` page to monitor the rule
   ![monitor](./_assets/view_monitor_kafka.png)

## Test

1. Use [MQTT X](https://mqttx.app/) to simulate temperature and humidity data reporting

   You need to replace broker.emqx.io with the created deployment [connection address](../deployments/view_deployment.md), and add [client authentication information](../deployments/auth.md) to the EMQX Dashboard.
   ![MQTTX](./_assets/mqttx_publish.png)
   
2. View data dump results

    ```bash
    # Go to the Kafka instance and view the emqx topic
   
    $ docker exec -it mykafka /opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server <broker IP>:9092  --topic emqx --from-beginning

    ```

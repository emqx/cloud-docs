# Event Topics

The Rule of Data Integrations provides several event topics available for FROM clause.

| Event topic name             | Explanation                     |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| $events/client_connected     | Client connect                  |
| $events/client_disconnected  | Client disconnect               |
| $events/message_delivered    | Message delivery                |
| $events/message_acked        | Message acknowledged            |
| $events/message_dropped      | Message dropped when routing    |
| $events/delivery_dropped     | Message dropped when delivering |
| $events/session_subscribed   | Subscribe                       |
| $events/session_unsubscribed | Unsubscribe                     |

This article will introduce the usage of event topics, and the meaning of each field from three aspects: client connect and disconnect events, message events, topic subscribe and unsubscribe events.

## Client connect and disconnect events

### Client connect

The topic of client connect is `$events/client_connected`, click on Rules on the left menu bar → Rules, click on Create and enter the following rule to match the SQL statement.

   ```sql
    SELECT
        *
    FROM
        "$events/client_connected"
   ```

You can test the SQL, view the return field after firing this rule.

The fields are explained as follows.

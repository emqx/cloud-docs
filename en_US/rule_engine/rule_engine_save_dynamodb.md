# Save device data to DynamoDB using the Rule Engine

In this article, we will simulate the temperature and humidity
data, and publish these data to EMQX Cloud via the MQTT protocol, and then we will use the EMQX Cloud
rule engine to store the data to DynamoDB.

Before you start, you will need to complete the following:

* A deployment (EMQX Cluster) has been created on EMQX Cloud.

* For professional deployment users: Please complete the creation of a [VPC Peering Connection](../deployments/security_features_and_settings/vpc_peering.md) first. All IPs mentioned below refer to the resource's intranet IP.

* For basic deployment users: No VPC Peering Connection is required. All IPs mentioned below refer to the resource's public IP.

## DynamoDB Configuration

### Create a DynamoDB table

You could create a new DynamoDB table by the following steps:

1. Download DynamoDB locally (using macOS X as an example):
   
   ```bash
   $ brew install dynamodb-local
   $ dynamodb-local
   ```
   
2. Create a JSON file called `temp_hum.json` to define a table called temp_hum

   ```json
   {
      "TableName": "temp_hum",
      "KeySchema": [
            { "AttributeName": "hum", "KeyType": "HASH"},
            { "AttributeName": "temp", "KeyType": "RANGE"}
       ],
      "AttributeDefinitions": [
            { "AttributeName": "hum", "AttributeType": "N" },
            { "AttributeName": "temp", "AttributeType": "N" }
      ],
      "ProvisionedThroughput": {
            "ReadCapacityUnits": 5,
            "WriteCapacityUnits": 5
      }
   }
   ```
   
3. Initialize table

   ```bash
   $ aws dynamodb create-table --cli-input-json file://temp_hum.json --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000
   ```   


## Rule Engine Configuration

### Create a new Rule

* Select `Rule Engine` from the left menu bar and select the `+ New` button to go to the page of creating a new rule.

   ![Rule](./_assets/dynamo_rule.png)

* Change the SQL command into the following:

   ```sql
   SELECT 

   timestamp as up_timestamp, clientid as client_id, payload.temp as temp, payload.hum as hum

   FROM

   "temp_hum/emqx"
   ```
   
   You could also test the sql command to see if it gives the results you want:

   ![testSQL](./_assets/dynamo_testsql.png)

### Add a response action

*   Towards the bottom of the page, click the `Add Action` button and select data persist for DynamoDB.
   
      ![action](./_assets/dynamo_action.png)

*   In order to add a response action, you need to create a resource first. Click on the `Create` button to a new resource.

*   In the creation page, fill in the DynamoDB information. You could always test connectivity by clicking the `Test` button before actually create the resource.

      ![resource](./_assets/dynamo_resource.png)

*   Click the `Confirm` button to finish creation and return to the creating action page. Filling in the information for the DynamoDB Table and click `Confirm`.

      ![table_info](./_assets/dynamo_action_done.png)

   Click the `Create` button at the bottom of the page to finish creating the rule. You could also monitor the rules by following:

   ![monitor](./_assets/dynamo_monitor.png)


## Test

1. Use [MQTT X](https://mqttx.app/) to simulate publishing temperature and humidity data

   You need to replace broker.emqx.io with the deployment [connection address](../deployments/view_deployment.md) you have created and add the [client-side authentication information](../deployments/auth.md) in the EMQX Dashboard.
   ![MQTTX](./_assets/psql_connect.png)

2. View stored results
   
      ```bash
      $aws dynamodb scan --table-name temp_hum --region us-west-2 --endpoint-url http://localhost:8000    
      ```

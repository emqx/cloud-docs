With the infrastructure provided by cloud providers, EMQX Cloud serves dozens of countries and regions around the world, providing low-cost, secure, and reliable cloud services for 5G and Internet of Everything applications.

## IoT Messaging Model

### *Two-way communication*

EMQX Cloud supports massive devices and application-side connectivity, providing secure and reliable two-way communication for applications and IoT devices:

![two-way-communication](./_assets/bidirection_communication.png)

In this model, EMQX Cloud provides MQTT services to connect massive devices and applications. It supports application-device and device-device two-way communication. This model is suitable for IoT applications with instant communication requirements, such as the smart home scenario, where the cell phone app gets the status information of smart devices. Users can send control commands to smart devices through app. Another example, in industrial scenarios, AGV robots communicate with each other instantly via the MQTT protocol to achieve multi-robot collaboration. The MQTT service supports not only the standard MQTT protocol, but also MQTT over WebSocket, CoAP, MQTT-SN, LwM2M, JT, /T808, etc.

### *Data Collection*

EMQX Cloud supports device data on the cloud. With the support of massive topics and data integration, data collection, filtering, transformation, calculation, and persistence can be achieved with low code.

![data collection](./_assets/data_collection.png)

In this model, the MQTT service provided by EMQX Cloud enables data collection, computation, and persistence. This model is suitable for IoT applications with data collection and persistence requirements, such as: in industrial scenarios, each IoT sensor collects real-time data to the edge gateway, uploads the data to the MQTT server through the edge gateway, and then the Data Integrations triggers data filtering, transformation, and simple calculation, and forwards the final result to other services or persists to the target database. EMQX Cloud provides a variety of access solutions for different functionalities of the network, industrial, and edge devices, and supports more than 70 industrial protocols.

### *Hybrid Model*

EMQX Cloud provides MQTT services to support hybrid applications with two-way communication and data collection models. Through capabilities such as shared subscriptions and data integrations, data is persisted while flowing from object to object and from object to application.

![hybrid model](./_assets/hybrid_model.png)

In this model, the MQTT service provided by EMQX Cloud not only bridges the device-device and device-application gaps, but also persists the required data so that non-real-time applications can subsequently make use of the acquired data. Typical of these applications are artificial intelligence applications where the data acquired by the terminal needs to be sent to the cloud, where the computational model running in the cloud is calculated and fed back to the terminal, such as item or face recognition applications. At the same time, a copy of the data needs to be persisted in the database for subsequent offline training and improvement of the AI computational model.

## Product Plans

EMQX Cloud comes in three plans, each with multiple specifications, and we support the deployment of your own fully managed MQTT service on the world's leading public clouds.

![edition](./_assets/pricing.png)

1. Standard: Get started with EMQX easily. Minimal configuration required.
2. Professional: For mission-critical applications with workloads. Advanced configuration controls, including TLS config, VPC peering, Data Integrations.
3. Premium: For building enterprise-grade IoT platforms. Supports industrial protocols, edge computing, and data persistence. Deployments can be customized to your needs.


## Product Capabilities

EMQX Cloud, a fully managed EMQX access platform service, provides device access, device management, message storage, and other capabilities.

### Device Access

Supports a massive number of device connections to the cloud, providing stable and reliable device-device and device-application two-way communication capabilities.

- Supports standard MQTT protocol (including MQTT over WebSocket), using the standard MQTT client library to connect to the cloud.
- Supports CoAP, MQTT-SN, LwM2M protocol, and private TCP protocol access to meet the needs of various systems access to the cloud.
- Provides different network devices and industrial/edge devices to access the cloud.
- Open source multi-lingual/platform access sample code, providing cross-platform migration guidance.
- Perfectly fits EMQ [edge computing](https://github.com/lf-edge/ekuiper), [edge industrial IoT](https://www.emqx.com/en/products/neuron) product ecology, supports dozens of industrial protocols to access the cloud.

### Device Management

EMQX Cloud Standard and Professional plans provide rich REST APIs that allow users to integrate with their device management systems and IoT platforms through APIs and Data Integrations. The premium plan of EMQX Cloud provides enterprise-class device management capabilities, allowing users to create and manage device objects directly with the enterprise plan, and manage edge endpoint devices and gateway devices with features unique to the premium plan such as device shadowing and cloud edge collaboration.

![device_manager_2](./_assets/device_manage2.png)

- **Device authentication information management**: The platform could add, delete, search, and update authentication information via REST API

- **Device online status view**:

  - The platform gets the list of online devices through REST API and queries whether the devices are online.
  - The platform rewrites the status of devices in the private database or sends it to the self-built service (Web service) when the devices are online or offline through the Data Integrations
  - Device offline alarm: Notify the platform when the device is offline and determine whether it needs to be alarmed

- **Device up/down history**:

  - The platform writes the up/down information to the private database or sends it to the self-built service (Web service) when the device is online or offline through the data integrations.
  - ACL Permission Management: The platform adds, deletes, checks, and changes ACL permissions through REST API.

- **Online device kick-off**: The platform kicks off the online device.

- **Proxy subscription**: The platform subscribes or unsubscribes topics for online devices through the REST API.

- **Publishing messages to devices**: The platform publishes messages to specified topics through REST API or MQTT access and supports batch operation.

- **Business statistics such as messages sent and received and number of connections**: Get the relevant statistics through REST API.

**Professional and Premium plans only**

- **Bridging/storage of device messages**: Store device events (up/down, subscribe/unsubscribe, message publishing) and message data to private databases (mainstream relational/non-relational, various temporal databases), message queues Kafka, and self-built web services via data integrations.

**Premium Plan only**

- **Device Shadowing**ï¼šIndirectly get the status of the device, whether it is offline or not, through device shadowing, and modify the device properties through device shadowing. Automatic synchronization of device shadow status when the device is online.
- **Edge Computing**: Create and manage edge gateways and end devices through the Premium plan management platform, and configure edge gateways and devices.

### Data Integrations

EMQX Cloud use data integrations to configure rules for processing and responding to devise messages and events.

Data integrations not only provides a clear and flexible "configuration-based" business integration solution, but also simplifies the business development process, improves user ease of use, and reduces the coupling between business systems and EMQX.

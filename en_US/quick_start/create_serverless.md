   On the **Overview** page, you can get the overall status of the deployment, for example, the instance status, number of sessions, Pub&Sub TPS, session minutes, and traffic. The page also lists the deployment name, address, and ports, we can use this information to test the connection.

   In the deployment detail page, click **Authentication & ACL** -> **Authentication** in the left navigation menu, click the **+ Add** button, enter the username and password and click **Confirm**.

   User **emqx** is created, and it will later be used for testing the connection to the deployment.

3. Test the connection to the deployment. 

   [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app) is recommended to test the connection to the deployment, or you can use [SDK or other tools](../connect_to_deployments/overview.md). Before the testing, you need to get the deployment connection address (Host) and port (Port) from the **Overview** tab.

   * Set up the MQTTX connection configuration as shown below and connect to the deployment.

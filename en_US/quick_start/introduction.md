# Get Started with EMQ X Cloud

Welcome to EMQ X Cloud! EMQ X Cloud is the first fully hosted MQTT 5.0 public cloud service in the world. With the support of EMQ X Cloud,
you can create an EMQ X cluster on the cloud and use all the features of EMQ X Enterprise Edition. This allows you to spend more time on business
connections and less time for EMQ X operation, maintenance, and management. This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating and connecting
to EMQ X Cloud deployment. Before starting, let's review some core concepts and phrases:

* Deployment: EMQ X Enterprise cluster hosted on EMQ X Cloud
* Free Trial: Single node version of EMQ X Enterprise
* Exclusive deployment: An EMQ X Enterprise Edition cluster with separate networks, instances, and load balancing

You can follow these steps shown below to quickly complete the EMQ X Cloud QuickStart.

## Configure Authentication 

To ensure the security of your data, it is necessary to add authentication information for this deployment by using the **Authentication & ACL** module before formally accessing various clients/applications. You can do this by visiting the [**Authentication**](../deployments/auth_dedicated.md) page under **Authentication & ACL**, and clicking on the Add button.

## Use MQTTX to Verify the Connection

It is recommended to use [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app) to test the connection to EMQX Cloud deployments. Alternatively, you can use familiar [SDKs or other tools](../connect_to_deployments/overview.md) to connect to the deployment. Prior to using MQTTX to connect to the deployment, you need to obtain the deployment's connection address (Host) and port number (Port).

The next page will explain how to test the connection using [MQTTX](../connect_to_deployments/mqttx.md).

## Create a Deployment

Log into the [EMQX Platform Console](https://cloud.emqx.com/console/), where you can view the summary information of the current deployment, manage projects and users, etc. This section guides you through the quick process of creating a deployment.

1. On the start page, click **New Deployment** to go to the New Deployment page.

2. Select the **Serverless** plan. Leave all the deployment settings at their default values.

   For detailed descriptions of deployment settings, refer to [Create a Deployment](../create/overview.md). 

   Confirm your deployment information in the **Summary** area on the right and click the **Deploy** button at the bottom. This stage will prompt you to review and accept the *EMQX Platform Services Agreement*. It's important to thoroughly read the agreement and accept its terms to proceed.

You have now completed the deployment creation process and need to wait for the deployment to be created. After the deployment status appears to **Running**, you can access the deployment overview page by clicking the deployment card just created.

## Configure Authentication

To ensure the security of your data, before officially connecting various clients/applications, you should also add authentication information for this deployment in **Access Control**. Go to the deployment's **Access Control** -> **Authentication** page [to add authentication information](../deployments/default_auth.md).

::: tip

Keep this user information safe. When using MQTTX to verify client connections, you will be required to provide the **username** and **password** established at this stage.

## Use MQTTX to Verify Connection

EMQX Platform recommends using [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app) to test the connection to your deployment, but you can also use familiar [SDKs or other tools](../connect_to_deployments/overview.md) to connect to your deployment. Before using MQTTX to connect to your deployment, you need to obtain the deployment's authentication information.

Next, we will introduce how to test the connection using [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app/zh/). For detailed content, refer to [Testing Connection with MQTTX](../connect_to_deployments/mqttx.md).

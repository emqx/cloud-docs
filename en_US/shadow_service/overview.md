# Shadow Service

## What's Shadow Service?

Shadow service is a **data cache service** provided by EMQX Cloud. Users can implement IoT applications quickly through Topics and APIs.


With Shadow Service, users do not need to set up cloud services, create VPC connections, or transfer data through data integration step by step. Instead, this capability is used to rapidly implement applications such as things models, device shadow, and other applications related to data reporting and distribution, resulting in significant savings in development and costs.

## How to enable the service?

### Brief Instruction

1. The memory for Shadow Service is in three sizes: 1GB, 2GB, and 4GB. The size indicates the storage and the maximum amount of shadow models. The maximum size of a shadow JSON is **128 KB**. The estimated amount of shadows that can be created is based on the file size.

   <tr>
      <td>1 GB</td>
      <td>8000</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>2 GB</td>
      <td>16,000</td>
   </tr>
   <tr>
      <td>4 GB</td>
      <td>32,000</td>
   </tr>
</table>

:::tip
The above figures are for reference only and the actual number of shadows that can be created is subject to the actual scenario. As shadows are generally smaller than the maximum size of 128KB, the actual maximum amount can be much larger than the above figures.

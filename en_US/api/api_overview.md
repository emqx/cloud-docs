## How to Use API
### Construct Request
The request address consists of the following parts:

{API}/{resource-path}?{query-string}

You can get the API access address in the API access section under the deployment details page

![api](./_assets/api.png)

### Authentication

HTTP API uses [Basic authentication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basic_access_authentication) method, ID and password must be filled in AppID and AppSecret respectively. You can add and remove AppID/AppSecret by creating new application in the API access under the deployment details page.

## Response code
### HTTP status codes

The EMQX Broker interface always returns 200 OK when the call is successful, and the response content is returned in JSON format.

The possible status codes are as follows:

| Status Code | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 200         | Succeed, and the returned JSON data will provide more information |
| 400         | Invalid client request, such as wrong request body or parameters |
| 401         | Client authentication failed , maybe because of invalid authentication credentials |
| 404         | The requested path cannot be found or the requested object does not exist |
| 500         | An internal error occurred while the server was processing the request |

### Result codes

The response message body of the EMQX Broker interface is in JSON format, which always contains the returned `code`.

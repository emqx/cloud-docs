# Connector

Connectors are used to connect EMQX Platform to cloud resources, which are services provided by cloud service providers or services operated by yourself. Connectors are only concerned with the connection to cloud resources, and users can create different connectors for different cloud resources.


## Create a Connector

2. Fill in the corresponding resource configuration and click the **Test** button. If the connection is successful, a success prompt will be displayed, and you can click to view it. If it fails, check the connector configuration.

# Bridge MQTT Data into RocketMQ

EMQX Platform supports bridging data into [RocketMQ](https://rocketmq.apache.org/), so you can forward MQTT messages and client events to RocketMQ. For example, you can use RocketMQ to collect sensor data from devices, log data, etc.

This page provides a detailed overview of the data integration between EMQX Platform and RocketMQ with practical instructions on creating and validating the data integration.

## How It Works

The RocketMQ data integration is an out-of-the-box feature in EMQX Platform that combines the real-time data capturing and transmission capabilities of EMQX Platform with RocketMQ's powerful message queue processing capabilities. With a built-in [rule engine](./rules.md) component, the integration simplifies the process of ingesting data from EMQX Platform to RocketMQ for storage and management, eliminating the need for complex coding.

The diagram below illustrates a typical architecture of data integration between EMQX Platform and RocketMQ:

Ingesting MQTT data into RocketMQ works as follows:

1. **Message publication and reception**: Industrial IoT devices establish successful connections to EMQX Platform through the MQTT protocol and publish real-time MQTT data to EMQX Platform. When EMQX Platform receives these messages, it initiates the matching process within its rules engine.
2. **Message data processing:** When a message arrives, it passes through the rule engine and is then processed by the rule defined in EMQX Platform. The rules, based on predefined criteria, determine which messages need to be routed to RocketMQ. If any rules specify payload transformations, those transformations are applied, such as converting data formats, filtering out specific information, or enriching the payload with additional context.
3. **Data ingestion into RocketMQ**: Once the rule has processed the message, it triggers an action of forwarding the messages to RocketMQ. Processed data will be seamlessly written into RocketMQ.
4. **Data Storage and Utilization**: With the data now stored in RocketMQ, businesses can harness its querying power for various use cases. For example, in the financial industry, RocketMQ can be used as a reliable high-performance message queue to store and manage data from payment terminals and transaction systems. It can connect messages to data analysis and regulatory platforms, fulfilling requirements such as risk management, fraud detection and prevention, and regulatory compliance.

## Features and Benefits

The data integration with RocketMQ brings the following features and advantages to your business:

- **Reliable IoT Data Message Delivery**: EMQX Platform can reliably batch and send MQTT messages to RocketMQ, enabling the integration of IoT devices with RocketMQ and application systems.
- **MQTT Message Transformation**: Using the rule engine, the EMQX Platform can filter and transform MQTT messages. Messages can undergo data extraction, filtering, enrichment, and transformation before being sent to RocketMQ.
- **Cloud-Native Elastic Scaling**: EMQX Platform and RocketMQ are both applications built on cloud-native architecture, offering friendly Kubernetes (K8s) support and integration with the cloud-native ecosystem. They can infinitely and elastically scale to accommodate the rapid development of business needs.
- **Flexible Topic Mapping**: RocketMQ data integration supports flexible mapping of MQTT topics to RocketMQ topics, allowing easy configuration of keys (Key) and values (Value) for data in RocketMQ messages.
- **Processing Capabilities in High-Throughput Scenarios**: RocketMQ data integration supports both synchronous and asynchronous write modes, allowing for a flexible balance between latency and throughput according to different scenarios.

## Before You Start

This section describes the preparations you need to complete before you start to create the RocketMQ data integration, including how to set up the RocketMQ server.

### Prerequisites

- Knowledge about [data integration](./introduction.md)
- Knowledge about data integration [rules](./rules.md)

### Install RocketMQ

1. Prepare a docker-compose file, `rocketmq.yaml`, to set up the RocketMQ.

```yaml
version: '3.3'

services:
  mqnamesrv:
    image: apache/rocketmq:4.9.4
    container_name: rocketmq_namesrv
    ports:
      - 9876:9876
    volumes:
      - ./rocketmq/logs:/opt/logs
      - ./rocketmq/store:/opt/store
    command: ./mqnamesrv

  mqbroker:
    image: apache/rocketmq:4.9.4
    container_name: rocketmq_broker
    ports:
      - 10909:10909
      - 10911:10911
    volumes:
      - ./rocketmq/logs:/opt/logs
      - ./rocketmq/store:/opt/store
      - ./rocketmq/conf/broker.conf:/etc/rocketmq/broker.conf
    environment:
      NAMESRV_ADDR: 'rocketmq_namesrv:9876'
      JAVA_OPTS: ' -Duser.home=/opt'
      JAVA_OPT_EXT: '-server -Xms1024m -Xmx1024m -Xmn1024m'
    command: ./mqbroker -c /etc/rocketmq/broker.conf
    depends_on:
      - mqnamesrv
```

2. Prepare the folders and configurations required for running RocketMQ.

```bash
mkdir rocketmq
mkdir rocketmq/logs
mkdir rocketmq/store
mkdir rocketmq/conf
```

3. Save the below content into `rocketmq/conf/broker.conf`.

```bash
brokerClusterName=DefaultCluster
brokerName=broker-a
brokerId=0

brokerIP1=change me to your real IP address

defaultTopicQueueNums=4
autoCreateTopicEnable=true
autoCreateSubscriptionGroup=true

listenPort=10911
deleteWhen=04

fileReservedTime=120
mapedFileSizeCommitLog=1073741824
mapedFileSizeConsumeQueue=300000
diskMaxUsedSpaceRatio=100
maxMessageSize=65536

brokerRole=ASYNC_MASTER

flushDiskType=ASYNC_FLUSH
```

4. Start the server.

```bash
docker-compose -f rocketmq.yaml up
```

5. Start a consumer.

```
docker run --rm -e NAMESRV_ADDR=host.docker.internal:9876 apache/rocketmq:4.9.4 ./tools.sh org.apache.rocketmq.example.quickstart.Consumer
```

::: tip

In Linux, you should change the `host.docker.internal` to your real IP address.

## Create a Connector

Before creating data integration rules, you need to first create a RocketMQ connector to access the RocketMQ server.

1.  Go to your deployment. Click **Data Integration** from the left-navigation menu.If it is the first time for you to create a connector, select **RocketMQ** under the **Data Forward** category. If you have already created connectors, select **New Connector** and then select **RocketMQ** under the **Data Forward** category.

2.  **Connector Name**: The system will automatically generate a connector name.

3.  Enter the connection information:

    - **Servers**ï¼šEnter the address of the RocketMQ server you want to connect to (e.g., localhost),A host entry has the following form: Host[:Port].The RocketMQ default port 9876 is used if [:Port] is not specified.
    - **AccessKey**: RocketMQ server accessKey.
    - **SecretKey**: RocketMQ server secretKey.
    - **Security Token**: RocketMQ Server Security Token.
    - Configure advanced settings according to your business needs (optional).

4.  Click the **Test** button. If the RocketMQ service is accessible, a prompt indicating **connector available** will be returned.

5.  Click the **New** button to complete the creation.

Next, you can create data bridge rules based on this Connector.

## Create a Rule

This section demonstrates how to create a RocketMQ Rule and add action to the rule via the EMQX Platform Console.

1. Click **New Rule** in Rules area or click the New Rule icon in the **Actions** column of the connector you just created.

2. Set the rules in the **SQL Editor** based on the feature to use, Our goal is to trigger the engine when the client sends a temperature and humidity message to the temp_hum/emqx topic. Here you need a certain process of SQL:

```sql
  SELECT

   timestamp as up_timestamp,
   clientid as client_id,
   payload.temp as temp,
   payload.hum as hum

  FROM

   "temp_hum/emqx"
```

::: tip

If you are a beginner user, click **SQL Examples** and **Enable Test** to learn and test the SQL rule.

:::

3. Click **Next** to add an action.

4. Select the connector you just created from the **Connector** dropdown box.

5. Configure the information for publishing messages from EMQX Platform to the RocketMQ service:

   - **RocketMQ topic**: `TopicTest`
   - **Message Template**:Template, the default value is empty. When this value is empty the whole message will be stored in the RocketMQ.The template can be any valid string with placeholders, example:
     ```
     {"up_timestamp": ${up_timestamp}, "client_id": ${client_id}, "temp": ${temp}, "hum": ${hum}}
     ```

6. Expand **Advanced Settings** to configure Sync/Async mode, queue and batch, and other parameters as appropriate Advanced Settings Options (optional)

7. Click the **Confirm** button to complete the rule creation.
8. In the **Successful new rule** pop-up, click **Back to Rules**, thus completing the entire data integration configuration chain.

## Test the Rule

You are recommended to use [MQTTX](https://mqttx.app/) to simulate temperature and humidity data reporting, but you can also use any other client.

1. Use MQTTX to connect to the deployment and send messages to the following Topic.

   - topic: `temp_hum/emqx`

   - client id: `test_client`

   - payload:

     ```json
     {
       "temp": "27.5",
       "hum": "41.8"
     }
     ```

2. In the RocketMQ consumer window, we will see the following output.
   ```bash
   ConsumeMessageThread_please_rename_unique_group_name_4_1 Receive New Messages: [MessageExt [brokerName=broker-a, queueId=0, storeSize=208, queueOffset=0, sysFlag=0, bornTimestamp=1711354009076, bornHost=/121.43.165.169:48850, storeTimestamp=1711354009085, storeHost=/118.178.124.161:10911, msgId=76B27CA100002A9F000000000000058D, commitLogOffset=1421, bodyCRC=1137462344, reconsumeTimes=0, preparedTransactionOffset=0, toString()=Message{topic='TopicTest', flag=0, properties={MIN_OFFSET=0, MAX_OFFSET=1, CONSUME_START_TIME=1711354066863, CLUSTER=DefaultCluster}, body=[123, 34, 117, 112, 95, 116, 105, 109, 101, 115, 116, 97, 109, 112, 34, 58, 49, 55, 49, 49, 51, 53, 52, 48, 48, 57, 48, 53, 54, 44, 34, 116, 101, 109, 112, 34, 58, 34, 50, 55, 46, 53, 34, 44, 34, 104, 117, 109, 34, 58, 34, 52, 49, 46, 56, 34, 44, 34, 99, 108, 105, 101, 110, 116, 95, 105, 100, 34, 58, 34, 109, 113, 116, 116, 120, 95, 97, 50, 97, 99, 102, 100, 49, 57, 34, 125], transactionId='null'}]]
   ```

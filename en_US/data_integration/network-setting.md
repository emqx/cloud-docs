Before you start, you need to create a deployment (EMQX cluster) on the EMQX Platform and configure the network.

- **For Dedicated deployment users**: First, create a [VPC Peering Connection](../deployments/vpc_peering.md). After establishing the peering connection, you can log in to the Platform Console via the internal network IP to access the target connector. Alternatively, set up a [NAT Gateway](../vas/nat-gateway.md) to access the target connector through a public IP.
- **For BYOC (Bring Your Own Cloud) deployment users**: Establish a peering connection between the VPC where BYOC is deployed and the VPC where the target connector is located. After creating the peering connection, you can access the target connector via the internal network IP. If you need to access resources via a public IP address, configure a NAT gateway for the VPC where BYOC is deployed in the public cloud console.

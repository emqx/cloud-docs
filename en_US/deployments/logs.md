# Logs

:::warning

This feature is available on Dedicated Plan and BYOC Plan. 

:::

EMQX Platform provides real-time online viewing of EMQX logs.

## View Deployment Logs

Logs analysis reconfigures the ability to parse and search for logs, providing two EMQX nodes [emqx-node-1], [emqx-node-2] with multiple levels of log information, including ClientID, ClientIP, Username, Topic, Resource, and Rule ID, as well as filtering by error type.

**Data Integration**: Data integration related errors. Errors caused by the corresponding service not running or other reasons. For example, MySQL is not running when storing to MySQL, unauthorized, or table errors, etc.

**Client**: Client-related errors, including incorrect authentication information, incorrect access control information, and other reasons for not being able to connect.

**Message**: Message-related errors, such as encoding problems, message loss and abandonment, etc.

**Module**: emqx module related errors, such as custom authentication errors due to inability to connect to the corresponding service.

**EMQX Internal Errors**: Erlang and errors that cannot be classified to the above cases.

# Metrics

Metrics provide key data states and changes in deployments over a period of time. You can view them on the deployment details page by clicking on **Metrics** in the left navigation menu.

## Serverless Metrics

The Metrics page for serverless deployment provides 5 types of metrics: sessions, subscriptions, messages, packets, and dropped messages. You can view the corresponding graphical charts for each type of metric and detailed information at a specific point in time.


### Sessions
The Sessions chart displays the number of clients connected to the deployment within the selected time period. The number of sessions also includes offline clients that have enabled [persistent sessions](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-session). Persistent sessions refer to sessions that remain active and store offline messages even when the client disconnects until the session times out and is cleared.

### Messages
The Messages chart displays the number of messages received and sent by the deployment within the selected time period.

- Inbound messages are the messages received from the device or application.
- Outbound messages are messages sent to the device or application.

### Packets

The Packets chart shows the traffic of the messages received and sent by the deployment during the selected time period, including the following three types of data:

- Total packets: Total traffic of packets received and sent.
- Sent packets: The traffic of packets sent to the device or application.
- Recieved packets: The traffic of packets recieved from the device or application.

### Dropped Messages

The Dropped Message chart shows the messages that are discarded during the sending phase within the selected time period. The reasons for messages being dropped can be that messages are too large in size, the message queue is full, or the message expires.

## Dedicated / BYOC Metrics

The Metrics page for Dedicated and BYOC deployment provides 5 types of metrics: sessions, subscriptions, messages, packets, and dropped messages. You can view graphical charts corresponding to each type of metric and detailed information at a specific time. For some metrics, the corresponding metrics in the API are indicated. If you need to learn and view more metrics, you can retrieve more metrics through the [API - Metrics](../api/metrics.md).

::: tip
If there is no corresponding API metric in the table, it means that the metric cannot be retrieved from the API.

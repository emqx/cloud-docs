# Overview

The EMQX Cloud Data Integrations is used to configure the rules for handling and responding to EMQX message flows and device events. The Data Integrations not only provides a clear and flexible "configurable" business integration solution, but also simplifies the business development process, improves user usability, and reduces the coupling degree between the business system and EMQX Cloud. It also provides a superior infrastructure for customization of EMQX Cloud's proprietary capabilities.

In EMQX Cloud, using the Data Integrations has the following requirements and restrictions:

- Standard Plan
  - The resource only supports public access, so you need to ensure that the resource has public access and open security groups before creating the resource.
  - Only Webhook and MQTT bridges are open for the resource type.
- Professional Plan
  - The resource only supports internal network access, so you need to configure VPC peering before creating the resource and open the security group.
- BYOC Plan
  - The resource only supports internal network access, so you need to configure VPC peering before creating the resource and open the security group.

## Alerts Integrations

EMQX Platform currently provides email, PagerDuty and Webhook event alerts integrations. If you need other alerts integrations methods, you can submit a ticket or email us.

### Send alerts to email

You can add a mailbox that accepts alert information in the page of alerts integrations, send to mailbox. When the deployment generates an alert, an alert reminder will be sent to the mailbox as soon as possible.

# BYOC License

The EMQX BYOC license is the service credential for each deployment, associated with key information such as deployment type and validity period. You need to subscribe to the EMQX Platform BYOC service to obtain an official license. For details on license pricing, please [contact us](https://www.emqx.com/en/contact?product=cloud&productEdition=BYOC).

This section primarily discusses the types of BYOC licenses, as well as how to view and update the BYOC deployment licenses in the console.

## License Types

EMQX BYOC includes the following three types of licenses:

- **Default License**: BYOC comes with a default trial license that supports up to 25 connections, valid for 14 days after deployment completion.
- **Trial License**: If you need to increase the number of connections or extend the trial period during the trial, you can [apply for a trial license](https://www.emqx.com/en/contact?product=cloud&productEdition=BYOC&pageType=applyLicense) from the sales team.
- **Official License**: Obtained after subscribing to the BYOC service, the number of connections and the validity period depend on the actual license issued.

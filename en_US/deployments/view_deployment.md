## [VPC Peering Connection Configuration](./vpc_peering.md)



EMQX Cloud supports peering connections with customers' existing VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for cloud service providers in the same region. A VPC peering connection is a network connection between two VPCs. Through this connection, the instances in the two VPCs can communicate with each other as if they were in the same network.

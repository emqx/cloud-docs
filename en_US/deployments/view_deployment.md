# Deployment Overview

In this tutorial, you will learn how to view deployment information, obtain connection addresses, view API addresses, etc.



## View deployment information

Here you can view the following deployment information:

- Cluster status: running status and running time.
- Number of connections: current number of connections, and the maximum number of device connections supported.
- Pub&Sub TPS: The peak value contains the total number of messages sent and received per second.

EMQX Cloud supports peering connections with customers' existing VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) for cloud service providers in the same region. A VPC peering connection is a network connection between two VPCs. Through this connection, the instances in the two VPCs can communicate with each other as if they were in the same network.

### What are MQTT over TCP and WebSocket?

The standard MQTT is a lightweight publish and subscribe messaging protocol for asynchronous data communication. It is built on the TCP/IP stack and can scale in unreliable network environments. Therefore, it is suitable for scenarios where device hardware storage space or network bandwidth is limited. 

WebSocket protocol is a new network protocol based on TCP, which enables the creation of a persistent connection between a browser and a server through a single handshake. Since there is no need for repeated handshakes between the browser and server, bi-directional data exchange between the two becomes much simpler. Specifically, WebSocket in MQTT refers to establishing a connection using WebSocket first and then communicating over the WebSocket channel using the MQTT protocol, i.e. MQTT over WebSocket, which is mainly used for connections in the browser environment.

Both standard MQTT over TCP and WebSocket are unencrypted, so there can be safety risks.


The MQTT over TCP port is 1883, which corresponds to the 'mqtt'. The WebSocket port is 8083, which corresponds to the 'ws'.


### How do I use the MQTT over TCP port and the WebSocket port?

You can view the sample code for testing and connecting by using SDK Demos at [Client Connection Guidelines](../connect_to_deployments/overview.md).


### What's MQTT over TLS/SSL and WebSocket over TLS/SSLï¼Ÿ

MQTT over TLS/SSL and WebSocket over TLS/SSL means to add TLS/SSL encryption to MQTT or WebSocket protocol communication. In this way, the communication is secured from eavesdropping and tampering.

The MQTT over TLS/SSL port is 8883, which corresponds to the 'mqtts'. The WebSocket over TLS/SSL port is 8084, which corresponds to the 'wss'.


### How do I use the MQTT over TLS/SSL port and the WebSocket over TLS/SSL port of a standard deployment?

For standard deployment, you can connect directly through port 15xxx (mqtts) and port 8084 (wss) on the deployment overview.

Standard deployment uses one-way TLS. EMQX provides and maintains server-side CA. Some clients may need a server-side CA for verification, please [download here](https://assets.emqx.com/data/emqxsl-ca.crt).


### How do I use the MQTT over TLS/SSL port and the WebSocket over TLS/SSL port of a professional deployment?

Professional deployment supports customized one-way/two-way TLS/SSL. You need to enable it via [Configure TLS/SSL](../deployments/tls_ssl.md).

### How do I use the MQTT over TLS/SSL port and the WebSocket over TLS/SSL port of a BYOC deployment?

The BYOC deployment supports customized one-way TLS/SSL certificates which configured during creating the deployment. You can connect directly through port 8883 (mqtts) and port 8084 (wss) on the deployment overview.


### How to write client-side code for TLS/SSL connection?

You can check sample code (TLS-related sample code) to write client-side code.

# BYOC Operation and Maintenance Service

For BYOC deployment, the EMQX team will provide monitoring, operation and maintenance services for your deployment. Below is a list of specific services.

## Real-time Monitoring and Alerting
We build a Monitoring and Alerting system that continuously tracks system performance, resource utilization, and service availability to ensure your deployment in good status.

Alert notifications are configured to promptly notify the operations team of any anomalies and service disruptions. Users can also configure custom alert notifications using various rule-based triggers.

## Incident Management
Incidents are reported to impacted customers by our O&M team via email.

Incident response plans are in place to ensure timely resolution and minimize the impact on users.

We have developed a robust and proactive incident response plan adhering to the requirements of the SOC 2 framework.

## Change Management
We have a change control process in place to manage system changes, including testing and rollback procedures.

Changes are effectively communicated to stakeholders to minimize disruption and ensure transparency.

## Backup and Disaster Recovery
Regular backups are performed to ensure data integrity and availability. The BYOC Agent automatically backs up EMQX's configuration and metadata every 8 hours, saving them in a mounted disk or cloud object storage as per customer requirements.

We have a tested disaster recovery plan in place to restore services in the event of a catastrophic failure.

## Patch Management and Upgrades

Regular system upgrades are performed to leverage new features and enhancements.

Communication channels are established to provide regular updates and notifications to users. Typically, our customer success team informs users via email before the update window.

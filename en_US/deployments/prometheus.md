# Prometheus Monitoring Alerts

:::warning

This feature is available on Dedicated Plan and BYOC Plan. 

:::

The Prometheus API is available in the EMQX Cloud and can be used to easily monitor critical metrics. In this article we will explain how to configure the Prometheus service, access to critical metrics from the EMQX Cloud API, and how to view metrics using Grafana.

## API Configuration

Go to EMQX Cloud Deployment Console, find Overview-REST API, get the API address, click on New Application, get the APP ID and APP Secret.

## Prometheus Configuration

1. Install Prometheus

    ```bash
    wget -c https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus/releases/download/v2.35.0-rc0/prometheus-2.35.0-rc0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    tar xvfz prometheus-*.tar.gz
    ```

2. Modify configuration file

    Go to the monitoring directory specified for your Prometheus service and modify the scrape_configs section of the configuration file prometheus.yml as shown in the example below.

    ```bash
    scrape_configs:
      - job_name: 'emqx'
        scheme: 'https'
        static_configs:
          - targets: [ 'xxxx:8443' ]
        metrics_path: "/api/emqx_prometheus"
        params:
          type: [ "prometheus" ]
        basic_auth:
          username: 'APP ID'
          password: 'APP Secret'
    ```

3. Launch and check service status

    Launch Prometheus

   ```bash
    ./prometheus --config.file=prometheus.yml
   ```

    Access your Prometheus service via your local IP with the corresponding port, e.g. x.x.x.x:9090 and check Status-Targets to confirm that the new scrape_config file has been read. If the status shows an exception, you may need to check the configuration file and restart the Prometheus service.

## Grafana Configuration

1. Install and launch Grafana

   ```bash
    wget https://dl.grafana.com/enterprise/release/grafana-enterprise-8.4.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    tar -zxvf grafana-enterprise-8.4.6.linux-amd64.tar.gz
    ./bin/grafana-server
    ```

2. Configure Grafana

    Access Grafana dashboard via the local IP + the corresponding port, e.g. x.x.x.x:3000. The initial ID and password are admin. You can change the password when logging in for the first time.

    ![Grafana](./_assets/grafana_data_sources.png)

3. Import Grafana Data Templates

    EMQX Cloud provides template files for Grafana Dashboard. These templates contain a display of all EMQX Cloud monitoring data. Users can import them directly into Grafana to display EMQX monitoring status icons.

    Access to the template ：[emqx_prometheus/grafana_template/EMQ.json](https://github.com/emqx/emqx-prometheus/blob/master/grafana_template/EMQ.json)，The EMQ.json file can be uploaded locally via Upload JSON file, or written manually via the import panel json.

## Metrics Details

After the system has been set up and running for a while, the data collected by EMQX Cloud Prometheus will be displayed on Grafana, including the number of clients, subscriptions, topics, messages, messages and other business information history statistics. You can view the corresponding display charts for each metric, and detailed information at a certain point in time.

Prometheus tracks the following metrics data for your EMQX Cloud deployment:

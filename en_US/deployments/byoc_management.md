# Manage BYOC Deployments

To meet the data compliance and security requirements of enterprise users, BYOC deployments only support managing basic operations and security features through the Platform console, including:

- [License](./byoc_license.md)
- [API Key](../api/api_deployment.md)
- [TLS/SSL Configuration](./byoc_ssl.md)
- [Metrics](./metrics.md)
- [Alerts](./alerts.md)

Other functionalities need to be managed through the EMQX Management Console, commonly used features include:

- [Client Authentication](https://docs.emqx.com/en/emqx/latest/access-control/authn/authn.html)
- [Client Authorization](https://docs.emqx.com/en/emqx/latest/access-control/authz/authz.html)
- [Banned Clients](https://docs.emqx.com/en/emqx/latest/access-control/blacklist.html)

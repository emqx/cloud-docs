# Access Control

Access control pertains to controlling permissions for publish (PUBLISH) and subscribe (SUBSCRIBE) operations, which can be implemented at three levels:

1. Client ID
2. Username
3. All users: controls permissions for topics without distinguishing between client ID and username.

:::tip TIP

- Access control uses a blacklist mode by default, ACL matching order is: All Users -> User/Client. The mode can be switched to whilelist via [ticket](../feature/tickets.md). <br/>
- The combination of clientid/username + topic is unique, which means that only the latest record for the same clientid/username + topic is considered valid.

You can use the following placeholders in your topic and EMQX Platform will be automatically populated with client information when requested.

# Access Control

Access control pertains to controlling permissions for publish (PUBLISH) and subscribe (SUBSCRIBE) operations, which can be implemented at three levels:

1. Client ID
2. Username
3. All users: controls permissions for topics without distinguishing between client ID and username.

:::tip TIP

- Access control uses a blacklist mode by default, ACL matching order is: All Users -> User/Client. <br/>
- The combination of clientid/username + topic is unique, which means that only the latest record for the same clientid/username + topic is considered valid.

## View Access Control Policy

Click **Authentication & ACL** -> **ACL** on the left navigation menu. You can switch between the three levels to view corresponding access control policy.

## Add Access Control Policy

For example to add an access control policy for certain clients, you can follow the steps below:

On the **Client ID** tab, click **+ Add**, fill in the **Client ID**, **Topic**, select the action for this target user (**Publish**, **Subscribe**, or **Publish & Subscribe**), then add **Permission** (**Allow** or **Deny**), and then click **Confirm** to complete the addition. 

:::tip TIP

Placeholders like %u (username) and %c (client ID) are allowed in the topic, and EMQX Cloud will automatically fill in the client information when a request is made.

The above steps also apply to the **Username** and **All Users** tab.

# Use limitations

EMQX Cloud has fewer usage restrictions than the public cloud IoT Hub platform. The limitations in the table below depend on the number of connections purchased and the hardware performance, and the corresponding parameters have been rigorously tested for performance by EMQ officials.

> The performance of the relevant items depends on the deployment specifications, and the specific data is subject to actual usage scenarios.

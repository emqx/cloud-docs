# Pricing and Billing

EMQX Platform offers a variety of flexible product plans and pricing options to support the deployment of fully managed MQTT services exclusively for you on the leading cloud providers, so you can easily scale up or down as your needs change, without any hidden costs or fees.

## Serverless Plan

EMQX Serverless Plan is billed based on the actual usage of your deployment, including the number of session minutes and the amount of traffic generated by messages. Each user is given a certain amount of free credits at the beginning of each month, which will be used first before any charges are incurred. After this free quota (session minute or traffic) is used up, you will then be charged for any additional usage.

### Billing Unit

**Connection time**: Calculated by connection minutes, where 1 connection minute is the unit for measuring 1 client connection to the deployment for 1 minute. Any duration less than 1 minute is calculated as a full minute.

**Traffic:** Traffic (including free traffic) refers to all public network traffic that flows in and out of your deployment.

**Rule Action:** The total number of action execution times in [Data Integration](../data_integration/introduction.md).

::: tip Related Terms

**Number of Client Connections**: The number of clients simultaneously online (including offline clients that have enabled persistent sessions) connected to the deployment.

**[Persistent Session](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-session)**: A session that remains active and stores offline messages when the client disconnects, until the session times out and is logged out.

### Billing Plan

| Billing Unit | **Free quota**                  | **Price**           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------|
| Connection time |  1 million connection minutes / month  | $ 2.00 per million connection minutes                      |
| Traffic     | 1 GB / month              | $ 0.15 / GB              |
| Rule Action     | 1 million rule action executions / month | $ 0.25 per million rule action executions |

### Billing method

**Connection time fee** = Number of connected clients * connection time (in minutes, rounded up to the nearest minute) / 1,000,000 * 2 <br />
**Traffic fee** = Inbound and outbound traffic（byte）/ 1024 / 1024 / 1024 * 0.15 <br />
**Rule Action fee** = Number of rule action executions / 1,000,000 * 0.25

::: tip Billing use case

Assume in a 24-hour billing period, a user has 120 client connections for 10 hours, 20 client connections for 10 hours, and 0 client connections for 4 hours, the total connection minutes are: 120 * 60 * 10 + 20 * 60 * 10 + 0 = 84,000, and the connection time fee is 0 if this falls within the free quota. If the free quota has run out, the connection time fee will be 84,000 / 1,000,000 * 2 = 0.168, rounded up to $ 0.17. 

The bill is calculated based on the fees accumulated in the previous 24 hours, with collections taking place at 0:00 daily. You can go to the [Billings](https://docs.emqx.com/en/cloud/latest/billing/overview.html) page in EMQX Platform console to find the details.

### Spend Limit

Spend Limit helps you control how much money your Serverless deployment spends each month, and you'll receive a reminder when you reach that limit. You can set the Spend Limit when you create your deployment, and you can change it later.

The spending limit can be an integer from 0 to 10000:

- If it is set to 0, the deployment will only consume the free quota, which is 1 million connection minutes, 1 GB of traffic, and 1 million rule action executions per month. When the free quota is used up, the deployment will be stopped.
- If it is set to an integer between 1 and 10,000, an action should also be selected when the consumption of the deployment reaches the limit for the month, such as stopping the deployment or reminding and continuing to charge. If there is an overdue bill, regardless of the action you previously set, the deployment will be stopped.

## Dedicated Plan

EMQX Dedicated Plan is charged based on the tier, and message transmission network traffic. There are no restrictions on the number of messages, API calls, or data integration usage. You can select the appropriate product plan based on your business needs, and be confident that the costs remain transparent and manageable even as your business expands.


### Billing Unit

**Base Fee**: The base fee for the instance is calculated based on the hourly unit price corresponding to the selected product plan and instance tier (maximum number of connections, message TPS) at the time of deployment. In practical usage, this fee is only related to the duration of usage and will not be affected by changes in usage (number of connections, message TPS).

**Traffic Fee**: Each instance tier includes a certain amount of free traffic. The free traffic is valid for the current month and any remaining amount will be automatically cleared at the end of the month. When device communication exceeds the free traffic, the excess part will be charged as traffic fees.

**Number of Client Connections:** The total number of clients simultaneously online (including offline clients with persistent sessions).

**[Persistent Session](https://www.emqx.com/en/blog/mqtt-session):** A session that remains active and stores offline messages when the client disconnects until the session times out and is logged out.

**Traffic:** Traffic (including free traffic) refers to all public network traffic flowing out of the deployment.

- Traffic through VPC peering connections or private network connections is not included in the traffic calculation.

- Traffic of messages received by the deployment (e.g., messages sent to the deployment by clients) is not included in the traffic calculation.

- If a NAT gateway is enabled, the traffic flowing out of the deployment is considered public network traffic and will be included in the traffic calculation.

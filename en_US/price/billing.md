# Billing

## Serverless

### Billing item

Serverless is billed based on the usage of the deployment, the **session minutes** generated by the clients and the **traffic** generated by the message. The deployment gains a free quota at the beginning of each month and uses it first. When session mimutes or traffic is used up, the usage will be billed afterwards.


### Billing method

EMQX Cloud accumulates **24 hours** of session minutes and traffic, and is billed at 0:00 daily. You can check [Billings](../billing/overview.md) to find the detail.

::: tip Tip
Assume in 24 hours, 120 sessions for 10 hours, 20 sessions of 10 hours, and 0 session for 4 hours, session minutes are: 120 * 60 * 10 + 20 * 60 * 10 + 0 = 84,000, and the session fee is 0 if it's under the free quota. If the free quota has been used up, then the session fee will be 84,000 / 1,000,000 * 2 = 0.168, rounded up to $ 0.17.
The traffic is calculated in the same way as the session.

## Dedicated

Price of Dedicated deployment is various from product plan, instance specification, and traffic. There is no limit to the number of messages, API calls, and data integrations. You can choose the product and specification to suit your business, ensuring that costs remain clear and manageable as your business expands.

Dedicated's billing consists of two parts.

| Item         | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Base Fee    | The base cost of the instance is calculated based on the hourly unit price corresponding to the product plan and instance specifications (maximum connections, message TPS) selected at the time of deployment. In practice, this part of the cost is only related to the length of time, and will not change due to changes in usage (number of connections, message TPS).
| Traffic Fee | Each instance specification includes a certain amount of free traffic. The free traffic is valid for the month and will be automatically emptied at the end of the month if there is any remaining traffic. When the device traffic exceeds the amount of free traffic, the excess will be charged. |

When you create a deployment, it estimates the cost of use based on your instance specification selection, and you can see the estimated price on the confirmation page before you deploy.

::: tip Note
When you create a deployment, EMQX Cloud will estimate the usage cost based on your instance specification selection, and you can see the estimated price on the confirmation page before the deployment.

# Configure SSO with Okta Authorization

If you manage your enterprise accounts using Okta, you can choose Okta as the authorization server for EMQX Platform and enable Single Sign-On (SSO). Additionally, you need to configure OpenID Connect (OIDC) settings in Okta. This page provides examples of OIDC configurations in both EMQX and Okta to help you understand the end-to-end configuration process for connecting an Enterprise Identity Provider (IdP) with EMQX Platform to enable SSO.

## Prerequisites

- An EMQX Platform Root account.
- An administrator account for Okta Workforce Identity.
- Be familiarity with Okta's enterprise account management. Refer to [Okta documentation](https://help.okta.com/oie/en-us/content/topics/identity-engine/oie-get-started.htm) for guidance.

## Step 1: Enable SSO in EMQX Platform

1. Log in to Cloud Console using your EMQX Platform Root account.

2. Click on the user icon in the upper right corner and select **SSO** from the dropdown menu.

3. Enter the SSO configuration flow and click **Enable SSO**.

4. Select `Okta` as the OIDC Identity Provider and click **Next**.

5. You can now view the **Redirect URL** on the page; this address will be used in the subsequent configuration.

5. In the **New Web App Integration** configuration page, fill in the following configuration information:

   - **App integration name**: Enter the app name, for example, `EMQX-SSO`.

   - **Controlled access**: You can fill this in based on your requirements; in this example, select `Skip group assignment for now`.

6. After completing the configuration, click **Save** to access the General page of the created application.

## Step 3: Configure SSO Information in EMQX Platform

Go to the **Configure SSO** page in EMQX Platform and follow these steps:

1. On the **Configure SSO** page in EMQX Platform, configure the following information:

   - **Domain**: Enter `trial-9021952.okta.com` as the Okta domain. The Domain field format is `{YourOktasubdomain}.okta.com`.
   - **Client ID**: Enter the Client ID obtained from the Okta application overview page.
   - **Client Secret**: Enter the Client Secret obtained from the Okta application overview page.
   - **Server**: If you don't have your own authentication server, it defaults to `default`. If you have your own authentication server, please enter `authorizationServerId`. For more Okta authentication settings, refer to the [relevant documentation](https://developer.okta.com/docs/concepts/auth-servers/).

## Step 4: Add Users and Authorize the Application in Okta

1. In the Okta administrator interface, select **Directory** -> **People** from the left menu.

2. Click **Add Person** on the main page.

6. You can see that the application has been authorized (**Assigned**). Click **Done** to complete the application authorization for the user.

## Step 5: Create Subaccount in EMQX Platform

1. Using your EMQX Platform Root account, go to the user management page in the Cloud Console.

2. Click **+ New User** in the upper right corner.

3. In the account popup, enter the same email account that was authorized in Okta: [Jack@emqx.io](mailto:Jack@emqx.io). Assign a role to this account. Refer to [Role and Authentication](./role.md) for setting different roles.

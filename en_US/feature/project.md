# Project Management

Projects provide the capability for multiple organizations or departments within a company to use and manage MQTT clusters independently, allowing for more detailed management of the platform's capabilities by assigning different roles. Based on projects, each organization or department can manage its own MQTT cluster independently and account for it separately. Under the multi-project mechanism, deployments must be established under a project, and a deployment can only belong to one project.

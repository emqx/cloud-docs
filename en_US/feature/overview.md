## [Project Management](./project.md)

Project management is used to group deployments under different projects, making it easy to manage deployments according to the projects.

## [Role and Authentication](./role.md)

Accounts management fulfills enterprise users' multi-role management requirements, by assigning different permissions and projects to different roles. 

## [Subaccount Management](./user.md)

By creating sub-accounts and granting them specific permissions, you can have more precise control over the management of resources and functions.

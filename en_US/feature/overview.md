# Projects and Accounts


## [Project Center](./project_center.md)

Project Center provides the ability for multiple organizations or departments in an enterprise to independently use and manage MQTT clusters, allowing different roles to be assigned to more granular management of the platform's capabilities. 

## [Project List](./project.md)

Project management is used to group deployments under different projects, making it easy to manage deployments according to the projects.

## [Role and Authentication](./role.md)

Accounts management fulfills enterprise users' multi-role management requirements, by assigning different permissions and projects to different roles. 

## [Subaccount Management](./user.md)

By creating sub-accounts and granting them specific permissions, you can have more precise control over the management of resources and functions.

:::tip
To confirm your credit card information, EMQX Platform charges $1.00 when you first link a credit card to your account. After EMQX Platform confirms your information, it refunds the $1.00 charge. If you encounter any issues with linking a credit card to your account, reach out to your card provider or banking institution to verify whether they declined the initial charge, which would prevent EMQX Platform from confirming your information.

- US bank account transactions require a significant amount of time for processing. It may take anywhere from 4 to 7 business days to receive confirmation regarding the success or failure of a payment.

# Taxation by Region

Your billing address determines your region.


If your billing address is **within** the United States (USA), you will be taxed according to the laws of each state.

If your billing address is **outside** of the United States (USA), add your VAT or GST Number in the VAT/GST ID field on the Billing Information.

If you enter a valid VAT/GST ID, we will not charge you VAT/GST (except for customers in Sweden). Remember to include the country code in the VAT/GST ID  (including a prefix of country code at the beginning and a suffix of numbers/letters for identification). By entering a VAT/GST ID you are confirming you are a VAT/GST registered business.


## Tax ID types

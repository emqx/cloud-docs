# Taxation by Region

The region for taxation purposes is determined by your billing address.

If your billing address is **within** the United States (USA), sales tax will be assessed and collected according to the rules and regulations of each state.

If your billing address is **outside** the United States (USA), such as the regions listed below, EMQX Cloud applies VAT/GST charges to your purchases. However, if you provide a valid VAT/GST ID, you will be exempt from VAT/GST charges (except for customers in Germany). By entering a VAT/GST ID, you confirm that you are a VAT/GST registered business.

- Australia
- Canada
- European Union (EU)
- India
- United Kingdom (UK)
- Singapore

::: tip
If your billing address is in Germany, EMQX Cloud always charges VAT, even with a valid VAT ID Number.

## Tax ID types

If you are located in one of the listed countries, please enter the specific type of Tax ID. By providing your VAT/GST ID, you will avoid any additional tax charges. If you are unable to provide a VAT/GST ID or if we are unable to verify it, you will be subject to taxes as mandated by your country's tax regulations. If you have a different type of Tax ID that doesn't match the default type, contact us and get help.

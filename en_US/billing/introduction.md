# Introduction

EMQX Cloud is in pay-as-you-go mode, so you need to bind a credit card before you can create a formal deployment.

Your EMQX Cloud usage is calculated by either the hour based on the specifications(connections and tps) of the deployment, and the region where the deployment are launched.
Pricing is per deployment hour consumed for each deployment, from the time an deployment is launched until it is terminated or stopped.

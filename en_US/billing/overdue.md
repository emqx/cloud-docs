## Overdue and Expiry

### Serverless
If your account has an unpaid bill, any Serverless deployments associated with it will be stopped, but not removed. To resume using them, you must settle the overdue bill and manually restart them through the console. Alternatively, if you have no further use for them, you can delete the deployment from the deployment list in the console.


### Dedicated in "Pay As You Go" Billing Mode
If you have an unpaid bill on your account, any deployments in "Pay as you go" mode will be stopped after our confirmation. However, your data, connection addresses, and subscribed network management services will still be retained, and you will be charged retention fees. If you wish to continue using the MQTT service, you must pay the overdue bill and manually restart it through the console. Alternatively, if you no longer require the service, you can delete the deployment from the console. Deployments that have been stopped due to overdue payments will be automatically deleted within a maximum of 7 days.

### Dedicated in "Annual Prepaid" Billing Mode
Once your deployments on prepaid expire, the deployment will be stopped after our confirmation. In case you wish to extend your subscription or require any other assistance, you can reach out to your assigned sales consultant or get in touch with us for the latest service proposal. If you no longer require the service, you can remove the deployment from the console. The deployments will be deleted after a maximum of 7 days from the expiration date.

### BYOC Deployment

When your BYOC deployment is authorized with a trial license and the license expires, the deployment will automatically be stopped. If you have completed your evaluation and are interested in purchasing, you can contact your dedicated sales representative at any time. If you do not wish to continue using the deployment, you can delete it from the deployment details page in the console to remove the related cloud resources from your cloud account and the deployment data from EMQX BYOC. Please note that even after the deployment is stopped, the public cloud platform will still charge you for the associated cloud resources.

When your BYOC deployment is authorized with a commercial license and the license expires, the deployment will remain operational. However, you will only be able to view the deployment status from the deployment details page in the console and will not be able to perform any new or modification operations. If you are interested in renewing your license, you can contact your dedicated sales representative at any time. If you do not wish to continue using the deployment, you can delete the deployment to remove the related cloud resources from your cloud account and the deployment data from EMQX BYOC.

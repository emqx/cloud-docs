## Overdue and Expiry

### Serverless
If your account has an unpaid bill, any Serverless deployments associated with it will be stopped, but not removed. To resume using them, you must settle the overdue bill and manually restart them through the console. Alternatively, if you have no further use for them, you can delete the deployment from the deployment list in the console.


### Dedicated on hourly billing
If you have an unpaid bill on your account, any deployments on hourly billing will be stopped after our confirmation. However, your data, connection addresses, and subscribed value-added services will still be retained, and you will be charged retention fees. If you wish to continue using the MQTT service, you must pay the overdue bill and manually restart it through the console. Alternatively, if you no longer require the service, you can delete the deployment from the console. Deployments that have been stopped due to overdue payments will be automatically deleted within a maximum of 7 days.

### Dedicated on prepaid
Once your deployments on prepaid expire, the deployment will be stopped after our confirmation. In case you wish to extend your subscription or require any other assistance, you can reach out to your assigned sales consultant or get in touch with us for the latest service proposal. If you no longer require the service, you can remove the deployment from the console. The deployments will be deleted after a maximum of 7 days from the expiration date.

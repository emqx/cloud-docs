# Overview

EMQX Cloud Bills are based on the consumption of deployements and other services within your account. This includes the total deployments and services created by both root account and subaccounts.

You can either pay as you go in an hourly base or make an annual prepaid purchase. For the plan pricing details, see the [Product Pricing](../price/pricing.md) page.

## Billing cycle

Billing for each EMQX Cloud deployment and service accrues at hourly intervals. Any usage that is less than an hour is billed for the full hour. All billing computations are conducted in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). 

Billing accrues hourly, with a monthly-in-arrears bill cycle. If you deprovision deployments that have accrued billed usage during the current month, billing will no longer accrue for these deployments, but billed usage accrued so far in the bill cycle will appear on your next bill and invoice.

Billing occurs on the first day of the month for the previous month. For example, if you start a deployment on September 15, you’re billed on October 1 for your usage from September 15-30.


## Monthly Bills

The estimated total amount of current month exclueds taxes. The total amount will be calculated in the beginning of next month which will include all the taxes and other charges.

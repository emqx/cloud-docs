# Overview

The charges for EMQX Platform are determined by the usage of deployments and other services across your account, encompassing all deployments and services generated by both the root account and subaccounts.

You can either pay as you go in an hourly basis or make an annual prepaid purchase. For the plan pricing details, see the [Product Pricing](../price/pricing.md) page.

## Billing Cycle

Billing for each EMQX Platform deployment and service accrues at hourly intervals. Any usage that is less than an hour is billed for the full hour. All billing computations are conducted in Coordinated Universal Time (UTC).

Billing accrues hourly and bills are generated monthly after the usage has occurred. If you remove any deployments that have already accumulated usage charges during the current month, billing for those deployments will stop. However, the charges incurred up to that point in the billing cycle will still appear on your next month bill and invoice.

On the first day of each month, you will be charged for the usage of the previous month. For instance, if you created a deployment on September 15, the bill for your usage from September 15 to 30 will be generated on October 1.

## Monthly Bills

Bill is issued monthly. In your Cloud Console, select **Billing** -> **Overview** from the top menu and you can see the details about your bill.

The **Monthly Bill** pane displays the cumulative usage amount. To modify the billing period, locate the option in the top right corner of the pane. You can select a billing period ranging from the current month up to the previous 12 months. The tax on the bills is calculated based on the information you provide to the sales team.

:::tip
Taxes are not included in the estimated total amount for the current month. The total amount, including all taxes and additional charges, will be calculated at the start of the next month.

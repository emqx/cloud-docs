# Subscriptions

With the subscriptions management, you can control whether annual prepaid deployments renew automatically or not. However, project managers are only able to view the deployments that are authorized under their projects.


::: tip
1. Each deployment can have its own automatic renewal status, which is set independently.
2. The duration of automatic renewal is extended for another year..
3. Autorenewal is only available for annual prepaid deployments.

## Subscription Rules

1. If automatic renewal is turned on for a deployment, the system will try to deduct the amount needed for one year of the current specification deployment using the reserved payment method, 12 hours prior to the end of the expiry time.


2. The automatic deduction will not be successful if there is an issue with the payment method.

# Introduction

Before connecting to the deployments, you need to complete the required operations for [Viewing Deployment](../deployments/view_deployment.md) to obtain the necessary information such as the deployment connection address and connection port. At the same time, you also need to add client connection authentication information in the EMQ X Dashboard [authentication and ACL](../deployments/auth_and_acl.md).

For free trial and shared deployment EMQ X Cloud, it provides TLS/SSL connection authentication by default, and you may also need to download [root certificate](https://static.emqx.net/data/cn.emqx.cloud-ca.crt) for TLS/SSL connection.

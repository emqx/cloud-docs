# Connect to the Deployment with C

This article mainly introduces how to use `Eclipse Paho C` in the C project, and implement the connection, subscription, messaging, unsubscribing and other functions between the client and MQTT broker.

Eclipse Paho Embedded C can be used on the desktop operating system, but mainly for embedded environments such as mbed, Arduino and FreeRTOS .

## Preconditions

### Install dependency packages

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get -y install build-essential git cmake
```

### Building from source

The continuous integration builds can be found on Travis-CI for Linux and Mac, and AppVeyor for Windows.

#### Linux/Mac

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.c.git
cd org.eclipse.paho.mqtt.c.git
make
sudo make install
```

#### Windows

```bash
mkdir build.paho

cd build.paho

call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat" x64

cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" -DPAHO_WITH_SSL=TRUE -DPAHO_BUILD_DOCUMENTATION=FALSE -DPAHO_BUILD_SAMPLES=TRUE -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE=TRUE ..

nmake
```

## Connection

> Please find the relevant address and port information in the [Deployment Overview](../deployments/view_deployment.md) of the Console. Please note that if it is the basic edition, the port is not 1883 or 8883, please confirm the port.

### Connection settings

This article will use the [free public MQTT broker](https://www.emqx.com/en/mqtt/public-mqtt5-broker) provided by EMQX. This service was created based on the [EMQX Cloud](https://www.emqx.com/en/cloud). The information about broker access is as follows:

- Broker: **broker.emqx.io**
- TCP Port: **1883**
- WebSocket Port: **8083**

### Include dependency library

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
#include "string.h"
#include "unistd.h"
#include "MQTTClient.h"
```

### Define connection addresses, authentication information, and message publishing and receiving topic

```c
#define ADDRESS     "tcp://broker.emqx.io:1883"
#define USERNAME    "emqx"
#define PASSWORD    "public"
#define CLIENTID    "c-client"
#define QOS         0
#define TOPIC       "emqx/c-test"
#define TIMEOUT     10000L
```

### Define the message publishing function

```c
void publish(MQTTClient client, char *topic, char *payload) {
    MQTTClient_message message = MQTTClient_message_initializer;
    message.payload = payload;
    message.payloadlen = strlen(payload);
    message.qos = QOS;
    message.retained = 0;
    MQTTClient_deliveryToken token;
    MQTTClient_publishMessage(client, topic, &message, &token);
    MQTTClient_waitForCompletion(client, token, TIMEOUT);
    printf("Send `%s` to topic `%s` \n", payload, TOPIC);
}
```

### Define the on_message callback function to print the content of the messages received by the subscribed topic

```c
int on_message(void *context, char *topicName, int topicLen, MQTTClient_message *message) {
    char *payload = message->payload;
    printf("Received `%s` from `%s` topic \n", payload, topicName);
    MQTTClient_freeMessage(&message);
    MQTTClient_free(topicName);
    return 1;
}
```

### Initialize the MQTT client and subscribe to topic

```c
int rc;
MQTTClient client;

MQTTClient_create(&client, ADDRESS, CLIENTID, 0, NULL);
MQTTClient_connectOptions conn_opts = MQTTClient_connectOptions_initializer;
conn_opts.username = USERNAME;
conn_opts.password = PASSWORD;
MQTTClient_setCallbacks(client, NULL, NULL, on_message, NULL);
if ((rc = MQTTClient_connect(client, &conn_opts)) != MQTTCLIENT_SUCCESS) {
    printf("Failed to connect, return code %d\n", rc);
    exit(-1);
} else {
    printf("Connected to MQTT Broker!\n");
}
// subscribe topic
MQTTClient_subscribe(client, TOPIC, QOS);
```

### Call the `publish` function in a loop to finish publishing the message

```c
char payload[16];
for (int i = 0; i < 100; i += 1) {
    // publish message to broker
    snprintf(payload, 16, "message-%d", i);
    publish(client, TOPIC, payload);
    sleep(1);
}
```

### The full code

```c
#include "stdlib.h"
#include "string.h"
#include "unistd.h"
#include "MQTTClient.h"

#define ADDRESS     "tcp://broker.emqx.io:1883"
#define USERNAME    "emqx"
#define PASSWORD    "public"
#define CLIENTID    "c-client"
#define QOS         0
#define TOPIC       "emqx/c-test"
#define TIMEOUT     10000L

void publish(MQTTClient client, char *topic, char *payload) {
    MQTTClient_message message = MQTTClient_message_initializer;
    message.payload = payload;
    message.payloadlen = strlen(payload);
    message.qos = QOS;
    message.retained = 0;
    MQTTClient_deliveryToken token;
    MQTTClient_publishMessage(client, topic, &message, &token);
    MQTTClient_waitForCompletion(client, token, TIMEOUT);
    printf("Send `%s` to topic `%s` \n", payload, TOPIC);
}

int on_message(void *context, char *topicName, int topicLen, MQTTClient_message *message) {
    char *payload = message->payload;
    printf("Received `%s` from `%s` topic \n", payload, topicName);
    MQTTClient_freeMessage(&message);
    MQTTClient_free(topicName);
    return 1;
}

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    int rc;
    MQTTClient client;

    MQTTClient_create(&client, ADDRESS, CLIENTID, 0, NULL);
    MQTTClient_connectOptions conn_opts = MQTTClient_connectOptions_initializer;
    conn_opts.username = USERNAME;
    conn_opts.password = PASSWORD;
    MQTTClient_setCallbacks(client, NULL, NULL, on_message, NULL);
    if ((rc = MQTTClient_connect(client, &conn_opts)) != MQTTCLIENT_SUCCESS) {
        printf("Failed to connect, return code %d\n", rc);
        exit(-1);
    } else {
        printf("Connected to MQTT Broker!\n");
    }
    // subscribe topic
    MQTTClient_subscribe(client, TOPIC, QOS);
    char payload[16];
    for (int i = 0; i < 100; i += 1) {
        // publish message to broker
        snprintf(payload, 16, "message-%d", i);
        publish(client, TOPIC, payload);
        sleep(1);
    }
    MQTTClient_disconnect(client, TIMEOUT);
    MQTTClient_destroy(&client);
    return rc;
}
```

## Test

1. Write the CMakeLists.txt file
   ```
   cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.17)
   find_package(eclipse-paho-mqtt-c 1.3.9 REQUIRED)
   project(mqtt_c C)
   include_directories(/usr/local/include)
   link_directories(/usr/local/lib)
   set(CMAKE_C_STANDARD 99)
   add_executable(mqtt_c main.c)
   target_link_libraries(mqtt_c paho-mqtt3c)
   ```
2. Compile and run code
   ![c_mqtt](./_assets/c_mqtt.png)
   
## More

In summary, we have implemented the creation of an MQTT connection in a C project, simulated subscribing, sending and receiving messages, unsubscribing, and disconnecting between the client and MQTT broker. You can download the source code of the example [here](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples/tree/master/mqtt-client-c), and you can also find more demo examples in other languages on [GitHub](https://github.com/emqx/MQTT-Client-Examples).

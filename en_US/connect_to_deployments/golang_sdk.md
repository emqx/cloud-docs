# Connect to the Deployment with Go SDK

This article guides you to use the `paho.mqtt.golang` Library in go project to realize the functions of connecting, subscribing, sending, and receiving messages between a MQTT client and a MQTT broker.


[Go](https://go.dev/) it's Google Developed a programming language with strong static type, compilation type, parallel style, and garbage collection function. `paho.mqtt.golang` is an mqtt library, which provides a simple API for connecting to the mqtt server and sending and receiving messages in the go project.

## Preconditions

>1. The deployment has been created. You can view connection-related information under [Deployment Overview](../deployments/view_deployment.md). Please make sure that the deployment status is running. At the same time, you can use WebSocket to test the connection to the MQTT server.
>2. Set the user name and password in `Authentication & ACL` > `Authentication` for connection verification.

The project uses go version 1.15.13 for development and testing. The following commands can be used to confirm the go version.

``` bash
➜ ~ go version
go version go1.15.13 darwin/amd64
```

## Install dependencies

1. Create a new folder `go-mqtt`, enter the folder and run the following command

    ``` bash
    ➜ ~ go mod init go-mqtt
    go: creating new go.mod: module go-mqtt
    ```

2. Use the `go get <Library>` command to install `paho.mqtt.golang`

    ``` bash
    ➜ ~ go get github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang
    go: downloading github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang v1.3.5
    go: github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang upgrade => v1.3.5
    ```

3. Create the `main.go` file and import the `paho.mqtt.golang` client

    ``` go
    package main
    
    import (
        mqtt "github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang"
    )
    
    func main(){
    }
    ```

## Connection

>Please find the relevant address and port information in the [Deployment Overview](../deployments/view_deployment.md) of the Console. Please note that if it is the basic edition, the port is not 1883 or 8883, please confirm the port.

### Connection settings

Set the mqtt broker connection address, port, topic, username, and password.

``` go
const broker = "broker.emqx.io" // MQTT Broker address
const port = 1883
const topic = "t/1"
const username = "emqx"
const password = "******"
```

### The key code of connection

We write a function to create and return an mqtt client.

``` go
func createMqttClient() mqtt.Client {
    connectAddress := fmt.Sprintf("tcp://%s:%d", broker, port)
    client_id := fmt.Sprintf("go-client-%d", rand.Int())

    fmt.Println("connect address: ", connectAddress)
    opts := mqtt.NewClientOptions()
    opts.AddBroker(connectAddress)
    opts.SetUsername(username)
    opts.SetPassword(password)
    opts.SetClientID(client_id)
    opts.SetKeepAlive(60)
    client := mqtt.NewClient(opts)
    token := client.Connect()
    // if connection failed, exit
    if token.WaitTimeout(3*time.Second) && token.Error() != nil {
        log.Fatal(token.Error())
    }
    return client
}
```

### Publish Message

Defines a publish function for publishing messages.

In this function, we define an unconditional loop to publish a message every 1s. Count the number of published messages through `msgCount`.
``` go
func publish(client mqtt.Client) {
    qos := 0
    msgCount := 0
    for {
        payload := fmt.Sprintf("message: %d!", msgCount)
        if token := client.Publish(topic, byte(qos), false, payload); token.Wait() && token.Error() != nil {
            fmt.Printf("publish failed, topic: %s, payload: %s\n", topic, payload)
        } else {
            fmt.Printf("publish success, topic: %s, payload: %s\n", topic, payload)
        }
        msgCount++
        time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
    }
}
```

### Subscribe Topic

Define subscription function to subscribe to messages. This function prints the topic and payload of the message on the console.

``` go
func subscribe(client mqtt.Client) {
    qos := 0
    client.Subscribe(topic, byte(qos), func(client mqtt.Client, msg mqtt.Message) {
        fmt.Printf("Received `%s` from `%s` topic", msg.Payload(), msg.Topic())
    })
}
```

### Complete code

``` go
package main

import (
        "fmt"
        "log"
        "math/rand"
        "time"

        mqtt "github.com/eclipse/paho.mqtt.golang"
)

const broker = ""
const port = 1883
const topic = "t/1"
const username = ""
const password = ""

func main() {
        client := createMqttClient()
        go subscribe(client)        // we use goroutine to run the subscription function
        time.Sleep(time.Second * 1) // pause 1s to wait for the subscription function to be ready
        publish(client)
}

func createMqttClient() mqtt.Client {
        connectAddress := fmt.Sprintf("tcp://%s:%d", broker, port)
        client_id := fmt.Sprintf("go-client-%d", rand.Int())

        fmt.Println("connect address: ", connectAddress)
        opts := mqtt.NewClientOptions()
        opts.AddBroker(connectAddress)
        opts.SetUsername(username)
        opts.SetPassword(password)
        opts.SetClientID(client_id)
        opts.SetKeepAlive(60)
        client := mqtt.NewClient(opts)
        token := client.Connect()
        if token.WaitTimeout(3*time.Second) && token.Error() != nil {
                log.Fatal(token.Error())
        }
        return client
}

func publish(client mqtt.Client) {
        qos := 0
        msgCount := 0
        for {
                payload := fmt.Sprintf("message: %d!", msgCount)
                if token := client.Publish(topic, byte(qos), false, payload); token.Wait() && token.Error() != nil {
                        fmt.Printf("publish failed, topic: %s, payload: %s\n", topic, payload)
                } else {
                        fmt.Printf("publish success, topic: %s, payload: %s\n", topic, payload)
                }
                msgCount++
                time.Sleep(time.Second * 1)
        }
}

func subscribe(client mqtt.Client) {
        qos := 0
        client.Subscribe(topic, byte(qos), func(client mqtt.Client, msg mqtt.Message) {
                fmt.Printf("Received `%s` from `%s` topic\n", msg.Payload(), msg.Topic())
        })
}
```

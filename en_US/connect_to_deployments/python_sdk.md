# Connect to deployments with Python SDK

In this tutorial, you will learn how to use the Python **paho-mqtt** client to connect to EMQ X Cloud deployment.



## Precondition

* Already [Create Deployment](../deployments/create_deployment.md) in EMQ X Cloud, and the deployment status is **running**

* Python 3.4+ version

* **Paho-mqtt** MQTT client has been installed. If not installed, please run the following command to complete the installation

  ```
  pip3 install paho-mqtt
  ```

* For basic deployment EMQ X Cloud, it provides TLS/SSL connection certification by default, and you also need to download [root certificate](https://static.emqx.net/data/cn.emqx.cloud-ca.crt) for TLS/SSL connection.

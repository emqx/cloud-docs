# Connect to the Deployment with MQTT X

This article will introduce using MQTT X as an MQTT client testing tool to connect the deployment of EMQX Cloud.

[MQTT X](https://mqttx.app) is a cross-platform MQTT 5.0 client tool open sourced by [EMQ](https://emqx.com/en), which can run on macOS, Linux and Windows, and supports formatting MQTT payload.

[MQTT X](https://mqttx.app) simplifies the operation logic of the page with the help of chatting software. The user can quickly create a connection to save and establish multiple connection clients at the same time. It is convenient for the user to quickly test the connection of `MQTT/TCP`、`MQTT/TLS`, and `MQTT/WebSocket` Publish / Subscribe functions and other features.

# Value Added Services

Value Added Services (VAS) are highly available service plans provided and maintained by the EMQX Platform. It helps to meet the specific technical and product needs of our customers. Value-added services are associated with the deployment you purchase. You can subscribe to related value-added services only after you purchase a Dedicated or Premium deployment. 

You can find all value-added services offered by the EMQX Platform by clicking **VAS** from the top menu. On the **Value Added Services** page, you can view or subscribe to the services.

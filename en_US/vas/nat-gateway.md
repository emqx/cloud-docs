# NAT Gateway

::: warning Note

This feature is exclusive to the Dedicated Edition. You need to create a Dedicated Edition deployment before purchasing this service. 

:::

The NAT gateway provides network address translation services. Before the NAT gateway is activated, some functions of the Dedicated Edition deployment, such as extended authentication and data integration, cannot access public network resources. Once activated, it allows access through public network addresses.

## Activate the Service

You can activate the NAT Gateway service by selecting the NAT Gateway card in the top menu bar under **Value-Added Services (VAS)** or choosing to open it from the tag bar at the bottom of the deployment overview.

## Use the Service

After purchasing the NAT Gateway value-added service, you can see the creation status of the NAT Gateway in the corresponding deployment overview, waiting for it to be completed. Once the NAT Gateway's status is running, the deployment can access public network resources.

# NAT Gateway

::: warning Note

This feature is exclusive to the Dedicated and Premium editions. You need to create a deployment before purchasing this service. 

:::

The NAT gateway provides network address translation services. Before the NAT gateway is activated, some functions of the Dedicated/Premium deployment, such as extended authentication and data integration, cannot access public network resources. Once subscribed, it allows access through public network addresses.

# Create a BYOC Deployment

EMQX Platform Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC) plan supports creating deployments in your own cloud infrastructure to ensure that data is kept in your environment. This deployment improves data security and control while avoiding risks such as data leakage. In addition, EMQX BYOC deployment can provide better performance and scalability to meet the needs of different scenarios. This page describes how to create and use a BYOC deployment.

## Prerequisites

Before you create a BYOC deployment, you must prepare an account corresponding to the public cloud, plan cloud resources, and apply for an EMQX BYOC product license. For more information, see [Deployment Prerequisites](../deployments/byoc_prerequisite.md).

## Create a Deployment

1. Log in to your account and enter the [EMQX Platform console](https://cloud-intl.emqx.com/console/).

2. On the console homepage or the deployment list page, click **New Deployment**.

3. Select the BYOC tab.

4. Configure the cloud platform and EMQX cluster according to your needs.

   **Configuration (for EMQX Cluster)**:
   ::: tip
   The maximum number of sessions must match the number specified in the EMQX BYOC license you request. After the deployment is complete, if you need to modify the sessions limit, you can contact us through a [ticket](../feature/tickets.md).
   :::

   - **Sessions Limit**: Specify the maximum number of concurrent sessions for MQTT devices connected at any given time.

   - **Pub&Sub TPS**: Specify the maximum number of transactions per second (TPS) for the messages sent and received.

   - **EMQX Node Instance Type**: Automatically selected based on the **sessions limit** and **Pub&Sub TPS**; You can also modify the instance type based on your actual business needs.

   - **EMQX Node Quantity**: Automatically filled based on the **sessions limit** and **Pub&Sub TPS**; You can also modify the number of nodes (2-5 nodes) based on your actual business needs.

   - **VPC CIDR Block**: Select the private IP address range used to create the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

   **Deployment Name & Project**:

   - **Deployment Name**: Enter a deployment name that has business meaning.
   - **Project**: Select the appropriate project.

   **Tags (Optional)**: Add cloud resource tags according to your needs for resource management, with up to 10 tags supported.

6. Review and confirm the information specified in the steps above, and you can also change the project to which this deployment belongs. After confirming the information, click **Deploy**.

Next, we'll start the deployment by following the steps in the **Deployment Guide** panel on the right.

## Run Deployment

We will complete the deployment in an Ubuntu 20.04 (AMD64) environment with a public network connection. Before you start, copy your TLS/SSL certificates and BYOC license files required for deployment to your Ubuntu environment directory.

## Add DNS Record

When the deployment resources is created, the system returns the following information. Based on the returned IP address, you can add a domain name resolution record to the DNS service to bind the deployed public IP address to your domain name. For basic concepts such as DNS and domain name resolution, refer to [DNS Concepts](https://developers.cloudflare.com/dns/concepts/).

```bash
Apply complete! Resources: 30 added, 0 changed, 0 destroyed.

Outputs:
cloud_register_data = <sensitive>
jwt_token = <sensitive>
lb_address = "120.55.12.49"
vpc_id = "vpc-bp1wllXXXXXXXXX5j8i0"
*****************************
You need add a record to your DNS service provider.
IP address: 120.55.12.49
Domain: myexample.mqttce.com
*****************************
Checking if https://myexample.mqttce.com is resolved to the 120.55.12.49 of the load balancer
```

You can choose DNS resolution services provided by your cloud platforms or other managed DNS providers. Taking Cloud DNS of Google Cloud Platform as an example, you can follow the instruction: [Add, modify, and delete records | Cloud DNS | Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/records). 

When the DNS record takes effect, the system returns `HTTPS listener is ready`.

```bash
HTTPS listener is ready
```

## Complete Deployment
After the domain name resolution is completed, the Ubuntu command line interface will output the following to indicate that the deployment is successful.
```bash
The deployment is successful! Here is the service information:
--------------------------------------------------------
EMQX service connection address: <Your Custom Domain>
You can log in to the EMQX Platform Console(https://cloud.emqx.com/console)
to manage your deployment.
--------------------------------------------------------
Thank you for choosing our service. Happy IoT!
```

## Advanced Network Settings


### VPC Peering Configuration

A VPC peering is a network connection between two VPCs that allows two VPCs in different networks to communicate with each other. This feature is provided by a cloud service provider and supports peering connections between the VPC where the BYOC is deployed and other VPCs in the same cloud service provider. To configure the VPC peering, refer to the VPC Peering documentation for each public cloud: [Working with VPC Peering - Amazon Web Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/peering/working-with-vpc-peering.html) and [VPC Network Peering - Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/vpc-peering).
### NAT Gateway Configuration

The NAT gateway provided by the public cloud platform can provide network address translation services and provide BYOC deployments with the ability to access public network resources without the need for VPC peering connections. You can add NAT gateways in the VPC where BYOC is deployed. For more information, refer to the public cloud NAT gateway documentation: [NAT Gateways - Amazon Web Service](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat-gateway.html) and [Cloud NAT - Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/nat/docs/overview).
## Connect to the Deployment

You can connect to the deployment using any MQTT client tool for testing, for example, the recommended [MQTTX](../connect_to_deployments/mqttx.md).
